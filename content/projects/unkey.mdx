## Object Detection During the Denman Voyage (RSV Nuyina) - Progression

This was a bit of fun I had conducting some object detection on Antarctic creatures.  
The idea was to capture creatures of the wild as we passed them, identify them, then log the captures to a file.  
It did not work out this way due to CCTV zoom capability and no control being a non-invasive coding project.  
So the project rendered the results as seen below — still fun.  
You can just make out myself on the heli deck!

To run this project on any web-based CCTV, find the URL link via the Google Dev tools.

### To use this repository

1. Run `CCTV_Camera_Listen.py` to retrieve the camera frames and save them to your desired directory.  
2. Run `YOLO_Detection_from_CCTV.py` from your desired directory. Considering I am just using a pre-trained model for this fun, the below is all that was required. YOLO certainly does make it easy!

```python
# Load a pretrained YOLO11n model
model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")
# Run inference on the source
results = model(source)  # list of Results objects



3. Finally, run `Video_from_YOLO_Detection.py`, which outputs the MP4 as seen below.
