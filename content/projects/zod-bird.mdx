## Part 1 – Plant Classification: YOLO and Keras

Plant classification is in conjunction with the `Genus-and-Species-Android-app` repository.  
The plant data comes from the University of Glasgow, covering **10,001 classes** of different species and genus of plants.

Most classes contain only a few to several hundred data points, making training very difficult. Solutions such as data augmentation and web scraping have helped to some extent, though inconsistently.

My current strategy involves breaking the dataset into many smaller models and exploring how these might be integrated into the final application – an area still under development.

### Training Results

Choosing the correct model was one of the most difficult and time-consuming tasks.  
Below are the results of a **Keras model** trained on the full dataset – typically requiring overnight runs.

> After 60 epochs, the model achieved only **1.4% accuracy**, even with Dropout layers and data augmentation to reduce overfitting.  
> This poor performance is largely due to the very limited data per class.

Each 10% chunk of the data had variable quality. To normalize this, I created balanced subsets through a script – a method I termed **_class equity_** – to reduce hallucinations and improve result consistency.

### YOLO Results

The YOLO model was able to correctly identify both **genus** and **species** with high accuracy.  
The two images below show results from 10% of the total dataset trained for 50 epochs.  
> For selected species, the model achieved nearly 100% accuracy.

## Part 2 – Plant Classification Android Native Application

This repository works in conjunction with the `YOLO-Detection (Plant-detection)` repo.  
The `.tflite` model file is stored in the `assets` folder of the Android app.

When running the app, users can scroll through the menu to select the correct model.  
Because too many classes overwhelm YOLO (due to data insufficiency), I’ve grouped the classes into several hundred per model.

> ❗ Currently, I can’t load multiple `.tflite` models with overlap. The app supports just one at a time.

### Application Details

This is a native camera app that continuously detects objects (bounding boxes and labels) in real-time using your device’s back camera.

Supported detection models include:

- [MobileNet SSD](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/lite-model/ssd_mobilenet_v1/1/metadata/2)  
- [EfficientDet Lite 0](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/lite-model/efficientdet/lite0/detection/metadata/1)  
- [EfficientDet Lite 1](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/lite-model/efficientdet/lite1/detection/metadata/1)  
- [EfficientDet Lite 2](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/lite-model/efficientdet/lite2/detection/metadata/1)  
- [Ultralytics YOLO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/detect/#models)

> All models trained on the [COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org/)
