## Project Status Quo

I am building an all-sky camera using a Raspberry Pi 5 along with a custom-designed Altium PCB. Currently, the components exist in two separate repositories, but I will be combining them once I have the network up and running from prototype!

### Progression List to Date
1. All items have been procured.  
2. A repository has been selected based on hardware requirements and amended for sensor.  
3. Sensor has been designed and ordered from JLPCB!  
4. Test network and upload images!

## Requirements for Allsky Camera (Pi5)

_Amended for SHT31 Temperature and Humidity Sensor_

To run the Allsky software, you will need:

- A Raspberry Pi Zero 2, Pi 2, Pi 3, Pi 4, Pi 5, or Le Potato.
- Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm 64-bit Desktop recommended).  
  Other OSs like Ubuntu are **not supported**.  
  __Buster support will be dropped in the next major release.__
- A camera:
  - Any ZWO camera sold before February 1, 2025,  
  - Or one of the following:
    - **Raspberry Pi:**
      - HQ (IMX477)
      - Module 3 (IMX708)
      - Version 1 (OV5647) _(Not Recommended â€“ 0.9s max exposure)_
    - **Arducam:**
      - 16 MP (IMX519)
      - 64 MP (arducam_64mp)
      - 462 (arducam-pivariety)
      - 64 MP Owlsight (OV64a40)
    - **Other:**
      - Waveshare imx219-d160 (IMX290)
      - OneInchEye IMX283 (IMX283)
      - IMX290 60.00 fps

### Humidity and Temperature Sensor â€“ SHT31

This is a basic humidity and temperature sensor utilizing the SHT31 chip. The design is similar to that of Adafruit. This PCB is intended to work in conjunction with the all-sky camera.
